  "Some helper utils for clojure.spec.")

; clojurescript related question, Iâ€™m working on a library which uses clojure.spec to describe a data structure
; using `s/*`, the data structure can be used statically during compilation in macros, or during runtime in cljs.
; all is nice and shiny on clj side[1], but on cljs side, I want native js arrays to be treated as collections f
; or the purpose of speccing, but unfortunately `s/*` does not treat them such. Ended up writing custom predicates
; for native array case[2], just wondering if there is a better way to teach `s/*`
; to walk native js arrays the same way as cljs vectors.
